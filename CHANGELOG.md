## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- An `extra-python-dependencies` input for specifying additional Python dependencies to install, in addition to any requirements files.

### Changed

- `python-requirements` is now marked as not required in the `action.yml` file. This is now checked at a workflow step level. See the next item for more information.
- Exit the workflow early if neither `python-requirements` or `extra-python-dependencies` are provided.
- Updated the Python hashing and installation steps to account for the new `extra-python-dependencies` input.

## [0.1.2]

### Added

- A new `release` workflow for automatically updating a major tag based on the latest minor or patch release.

## [0.1.1]

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug when passing in multiple requirements files for Python. (Hopefully!)

## [0.1.0]

Initial release! ðŸŽ‰
### Added

- Initial `action.yml` file containing composite GitHub Action for setting up Python and Node.js CI environments.
